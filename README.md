📊 Data Visualization Task 1 | Data Science Internship

As part of my Data Science Internship, I worked on visualizing data distributions using bar charts and histograms.

🔹 Created a bar chart to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable (e.g., gender).
🔹 Created a histogram to analyze the distribution of a continuous variable (e.g., age).
🔹 Focused on identifying patterns, frequency distributions, and meaningful insights from data.

🛠 Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
📚 Key Learnings:
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Choosing appropriate visualizations
✔ Interpreting real-world data distributions

This task helped me strengthen my foundation in data visualization and data analysis, which are essential skills in Data Science.
